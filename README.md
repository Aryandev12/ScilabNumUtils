# Numerical-Methods-Scilab

## Description:

Welcome to the Numerical Methods in Scilab repository! This collection of programs offers implementations of essential numerical techniques for solving mathematical problems efficiently and accurately. Whether you're a student learning numerical analysis or a professional seeking reliable methods for real-world applications, these programs provide valuable tools to enhance your computational skills.

## Included Methods:

1. **Gauss-Seidel Method:** Solve systems of linear equations iteratively, efficiently converging to the solution.

2. **Newton-Raphson Method:** Find roots of nonlinear equations through iterative approximation, offering rapid convergence.

3. **Gauss-Jacobi Method:** Another iterative technique for solving systems of linear equations, offering an alternative approach to Gauss-Seidel.

4. **Bisection Method:** Locate the roots of continuous functions within a given interval using a simple and robust algorithm.

5. **Regula Falsi Method:** Also known as the false position method, this technique refines the bisection method by using linear interpolation, often converging faster.

## How to Use:

Each method is implemented as a standalone Scilab script, providing clear and concise implementations for easy understanding and modification. You can simply download the scripts, execute them in your Scilab environment, and input your problem parameters to obtain solutions quickly and accurately.

## Contributions:

Contributions to enhance existing methods, add new methods, or improve documentation are highly encouraged! Feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit pull requests to collaborate with the community and improve the overall quality and usability of these numerical tools.
